# glaz

This tool helps me keeping track of my [gleitende Arbeitszeit](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleitzeit) (means: flextime) in my Excel time sheets.

It's very easy to install and use (assuming you use the same sheet as I and you store it in the same directory as I):

```
# install
$ go get github.com/5nord/glaz/cmd/glaz

# check-in
$ glaz in

# check-out
$ glaz out

# get state
$ glaz
```
